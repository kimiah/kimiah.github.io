I am a third-year PhD student at [MIT](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/), working with [Marzyeh Ghassemi](https://www.marzyehghassemi.com/). My research focuses on **data-centric** approaches to **reliable and safe AI**. 
I am broadly interested in how choices about data—what we pretrain on, how we shape learning targets and feedback signals, and how we evaluate—affect model behavior. I build methods that turn these insights into practical ways to improve reliability and performance. Among other directions, I have previously worked on problems in uncertainty quantification, data-efficient post-training, and training data composition.

During my PhD, I have interned at [Microsoft Research New England](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-england/) and [Google DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/). I previously completed my M.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Toronto and Vector Institute and B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology.
